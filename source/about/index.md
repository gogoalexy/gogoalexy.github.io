Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.

Here is an interdisciplinary engineer with both programming skills and knowledge of biology. That may sound weird at first glance. Well, as the more details of biological systems we know, we rely more on computers to analyze or simulate the experiment results. We could further apply these insights to engineering to improve human life. And my skills are perfectly suitable for transferring those discoveries in biology into applications.

I'm interested in photography, especially astrophotography. My current gear is OM SYSTEM OM-5 with 12-45 F4.0 and 40-150 F4.0 lenses. I always bring them while going traveling and hiking. Though I'm a software engineer, personally, I do some 'maker' projects with basic electric circuits and 3D printing.

If you'd like to know more about me formally, you can find my [résumé](/about/resume.pdf)
