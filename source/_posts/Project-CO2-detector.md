This is a quick hands-on project asked by my Master's degree instructor. According to studies, work 
performance significantly decreases under a high-CO<sub>2</sub> concentration environment. This 
little cubic device monitors the CO<sub>2</sub> centration, temperature, and humidity in the office 
which helps my labmates pay attention to the ventilation.

## Tech Stack
* Arduino: An Arduino Uno board regularly refreshes the environmental data for the sensors and 
displays it on a tiny display.  
* 3D printing: The detector's white case was designed with FreeCAD and printed with an
Ultimaker 2+ 3D printer.
