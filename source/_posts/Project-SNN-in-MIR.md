This is a term project of the music information retrieval (MIR) course. It shows an unordinary 
solution in the MIR field, which introduced spiking neural networks (SNN) to detect musical note 
onsets in music clips.

## Tech Stacks
* Programming language: Python with [Brian 2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) 
and [NEST](https://www.nest-simulator.org/) SNN simulators.
* Neural network: A heuristically designed network (shown at the top of the page) for onset 
detection.
